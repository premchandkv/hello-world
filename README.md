# hello-world
Just starting out with github
this file is being written for no particular reason. I am starting to get used to github as a tool to publish code with. I am in the process of relearning web development to land a good position. My aim is to make a good difference in the world; to augment it for the better. to automate the mundane things so that human beings can focus on the important stuff, and aim towards mental and spiritual evolution of all of us together as the superior species of the planet.
